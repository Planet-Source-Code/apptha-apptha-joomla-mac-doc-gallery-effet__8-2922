### Source Code

```
This joomla component is integrated with mac doc effect and smooth gallery , giving your photo gallery a classy look with slideshow effect .When the mouse or pointer is rolled over the photos, the photo which is in contact with the pointer gets blown up and brought to the fore whereas the rest of the photos go to the back.
The â€œMac effectâ€™ component embeds Smooth Gallery into it. This is a slideshow which can either automatically show the next image (after a changeable amount of time) or the user can switch to the next and previous image.
Best feature is that thumbnails are generated automatically which gives the user a hassle-free experience to view a particular image. By adding such an interactive Photo Gallery, one can create a dynamic website with exquisite look.
